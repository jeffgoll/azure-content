# What's Machine Learning?
Machine learning is in action all around you.  When you shop online, machine learning helps recommend what else to buy based on what you've purchased.  When your credit card is swiped, machine learning helps the bank do fraud detection and notify you if the transaction seems suspicious.  This is done by creating models and learning from existing data.  And now, you can easily do predictive analytics using Azure Machine Learning.

# What's Azure Machine Learning?
Azure Machine Learning is a powerful cloud-based predictive analytics service that makes it possible to quickly create analytics solutions.  It is a fully managed service - which means you do not need to buy any hardware nor manage VMs manually.

You can use the browser-based machine learning IDE to quickly create and automate machine learning workflows.  You can drag/drop hundreds of existing ML libraries to jump-start your predictive analytics solutions, and then optionally add your own custom R and Python scripts to extend them.  The IDE works in any browser and enables you to rapidly develop and iterate on solutions.

You can easily discover and create web services, train/retrain your models through APIs, manage endpoints and scale web services on a per customer basis, and configure diagnostics for service monitoring and debugging.  The newest features include:

- The ability to create a configurable custom R module, incorporate your own train/predict R-scripts, and add python scripts using a large ecosystem of libraries such as numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn etc. You can now train on terabytes of data using “Learning with Counts”, use PCA or one-class SVM for anomaly detection, and easily modify, filter, and clean data using familiar SQLite. 
- Azure ML Community Gallery that allows you to discover & learn experiments, and share through Twitter and LinkedIn. You can purchase marketplace apps through an Azure subscription and consume finished web services for Recommendation, Text Analytics, and Anomaly Detection directly from the Azure Marketplace. 
- A step-by-step guide for the Data Science journey from raw data to a consumable web service to ease the path for cloud-based data science. We have added the ability to use popular tools such as iPython Notebook and Python Tools for Visual Studio along with Azure ML.

# Get Started Now
You can learn the basics of predictive analytics and machine learning using our [step-by-step data science guide](https://studio.azureml.net/) and tutorials.  No sign-up or credit card is required to get started using Azure Machine Learning (you can use the machine learning IDE and try experiments for free).
